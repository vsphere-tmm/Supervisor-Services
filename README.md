## vSphere Kubernetes Service

VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS, formerly known as the VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service or TKG Service) lets you deploy Kubernetes workload clusters on the vSphere Supervisor (formerly known as the vSphere IaaS control plane). Starting with vSphere 8.0 Update 3, VKS is installed as a Supervisor Service. This architectural change decouples VKS from Supervisor releases and lets you upgrade VKS independently of vCenter Server and Supervisor.

- Service install [documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-iaas-cp-update/GUID-2005FFCD-07F4-450E-BAE5-445BE9D629AE.html)

## Cloud Native Registry Service

<img src="harbor-logo.png" width="250" title="Harbor Logo">

Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content. Harbor extends the open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and management. Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency. Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.

- The [contour package](#contour) is a prerequisite for Harbor v2.9.x, so that must be installed
  first if you are using v2.9.x.
- Harbor v2.11.2 supports exposing the registry using loadbalancer, and contour is not required.
- Follow the instructions under [Installing and Configuring Harbor on a Supervisor](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-services-workloads/GUID-8C645717-C473-4E67-8DEE-049B71447B86.html).

- v0.13.4
- v0.11.0

ExternalDNS data `values.yaml`

- Because of the large list of supported DNS providers, we do not supply complete sample configuration values here. If you're deploying ExternalDNS with Harbor and Contour, make sure to include `source=contour-httpproxy` in the configuration values. An *incomplete* example of the service configuration is included below. Make sure to setup API access to your DNS server and include authentication details with the service configuration.

```yaml
deployment:
  args:
  - --source=contour-httpproxy
  - --source=service
  - --log-level=debug
```

Validated Supported DNS Server Example:
- RFC2136 BIND DNS Server: Sample values can be downloaded from the same location as service.yaml. Replace the values indicated by the comments with your own DNS server details.

## NSX Management Proxy

NSX Management Proxy is for Antrea-NSX adapter in Kubernetes clusters deployed by VKS to reach NSX manager. We recommend to use NSX Management Proxy when there is isolation between management network and workload network and the Kubernetes clusters cannot reach NSX manager.

The RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator provides a consistent and easy way to deploy RabbitMQ clusters to Kubernetes and run them, including "day two" (continuous) operations. RabbitMQ clusters deployed using the Operator can be used by applications running on or outside Kubernetes. For a detailed description of how to consume the RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator, see the [RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator project.](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/operator-overview)

### RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator Versions

- Download latest version: [RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator v2.8.0](supervisor-services-labs/rabbitmq-operator/v2.8.0/rabbitmq-operator.yaml)

RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator Sample `values.yaml` -

- Modify the latest [values.yaml](supervisor-services-labs/rabbitmq-operator/v2.8.0/values.yaml) by providing a new location for the RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator image. This may be required to overcome DockerHub's rate-limiting issues. The RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator pods and related artifacts get deployed in the `svc-rabbitmq-operator-domain-xx` namespace.

#### Usage:

## KEDA

<img src="supervisor-services-labs/keda/keda.svg" width="200" title="Keda Logo" id="keda">

KEDA is a single-purpose and lightweight component that can be added into any Kubernetes cluster. KEDA works alongside standard Kubernetes components like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and can extend functionality without overwriting or duplication. With KEDA you can explicitly map the apps you want to use event-driven scale, with other apps continuing to function. This makes KEDA a flexible and safe option to run alongside any number of any other Kubernetes applications or frameworks. For a detailed description of how to use KEDA, see the [Keda project.](https://keda.sh/)

### KEDA Versions

- Download latest version: [KEDA v2.13.1](supervisor-services-labs/keda/v2.13.1/keda.yaml) Note: This version supports Kubernetes v1.27 - v1.29.

KEDA Sample `values.yaml` -

- We do not provide this package's default `values.yaml`. This operator requires minimal configurations, and the necessary pods get deployed in the `svc-kedaxxx` namespace.

#### Usage:

- View an example of how to use KEDA `ScaledObject` to scale an NGINX deployment [here](supervisor-services-labs/keda/usage.md).
