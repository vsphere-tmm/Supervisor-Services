#### Please refer to [How to find and install Supervisor Services](#how-to-find-and-install-supervisor-services) to find and install supervisor services.

VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS, formerly known as the VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service or TKG Service) lets you deploy Kubernetes workload clusters on the vSphere Supervisor (formerly known as the vSphere IaaS control plane). Starting with vSphere 8.0 Update 3, VKS is installed as a Supervisor Service. This architectural change decouples VKS from Supervisor releases and lets you upgrade VKS independently of vCenter Server and Supervisor.

ClusterIssuers are Kubernetes resources that represent certificate authorities (CAs) that are able to generate signed certificates by honoring certificate signing requests. All cert-manager certificates require a referenced issuer that is in a ready condition to attempt to honor the request.

- Service install - Follow steps 1 - 5 in the [documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-services-workloads/GUID-4843E6C6-747E-43B1-AC55-8F02299CC10E.html) then continue to the bullet point below.
- Read [Service Configuration](caclusterissuer/README.md) to understand how to install your root CA into the ca-clusterissuer.

### CA Cluster Issuer Versions

- v0.0.2
- v0.0.1

CA Cluster Issuer Sample `values.yaml`

- We do not provide any default values for this package. Instead, we encourage that you generate certificates. Please read [How-To Deploy a self-signed CA Issuer and Request a Certificate](https://github.com/vsphere-tmm/vsphere-with-tanzu-dev-center/tree/main/cert-manager#how-to-deploy-a-self-signed-ca-issuer-and-request-a-certificate) for information on how to create a self-signed certificate.

<img src="harbor-logo.png" width="250" title="Harbor Logo">

Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content. Harbor extends the open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and management. Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency. Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.

- Since v2.11.2, Harbor supervisor service supports exposing the registry using a load balancer.  Contour is optional, depending on the "enableNginxLoadBalancer" and "enableContourHttpProxy" settings.
- Follow the instructions under [Installing and Configuring Harbor on a Supervisor](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-services-workloads/GUID-8C645717-C473-4E67-8DEE-049B71447B86.html).

<img src="external-dns-logo.png" width="250" title="External DNS Logo" id="external-dns">

ExternalDNS publishes DNS records for applications to DNS servers, using a declarative, Kubernetes-native interface. This operator connects to your DNS server (not included here). For a list of supported DNS providers and their corresponding configuration settings, see the [upstream external-dns project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns).

- On Supervisors where Harbor is deployed with Contour, ExternalDNS may be used to publish a DNS hostname for the Harbor service.

### ExternalDNS Versions

- v0.16.1+vmware.2
- v0.14.2

ExternalDNS data `values.yaml`

- Because of the large list of supported DNS providers, we do not supply complete sample configuration values here. If you're deploying ExternalDNS with Harbor and Contour, make sure to include `source=contour-httpproxy` in the configuration values. An *incomplete* example of the service configuration is included below. Make sure to setup API access to your DNS server and include authentication details with the service configuration.
- Enabled RFC2136 TLS Connection Configuration from release 0.16.1. Detailed parameters refer to [external-dns/README-0.16.1.md](external-dns/README-0.16.1.md).

```yaml
---
#! use tlsConfig to enable TLS connection with BIND server
#! and require BIND server enables TLS meanwhile
#! if want to keep using nonTLS connection, comment or remove the tlsConfig part
tlsConfig:

## [Supervisor Management Proxy](https://support.broadcom.com) <a id='supervisor-management-proxy'></a>

#### Please refer to [How to find and install Supervisor Services](#how-to-find-and-install-supervisor-services) to find and install supervisor services.

Supervisor Management Proxy is required when there is isolation between management network and workload network and the VKS clusters in workload network cannot reach components running in management network.

Supervisor Management Proxy supports following usecases:
- Antrea-NSX adapter in VKS cluster to reach NSX manager. (Same as NSX Management Proxy)
- Send metrics from VKS Clusters to VCF Ops when monitoring VKS Clusters in VCF Ops.
- Callback into VKSM from auto-attach service and VKS clusters. (added in v0.4.0)
- Allow DPCA, VCFA and VC to be connected from the workload network. (added in v0.4.0)

### Supervisor Management Proxy Versions

- v0.4.0 (requires vSphere 9.0.1 or later)
- v0.3.0 (requires vSphere 9.0 or later)

Supervisor Management Proxy Sample `values.yaml`
- Download sample values.yaml from the same location as Service yaml.
- For Antrea-NSX usecase, make sure to fill the property `nsxManagers` with your NSX Manager IP(s).
- For other usecases, no need to fill any property in data values to configure the Supervisor Management Proxy.

## [NSX Management Proxy](https://support.broadcom.com) <a id='nsx-management-proxy'></a>

#### Please refer to [How to find and install Supervisor Services](#how-to-find-and-install-supervisor-services) to find and install supervisor services.

NSX Management Proxy is for Antrea-NSX adapter in Kubernetes clusters deployed by VKS to reach NSX manager. NSX Management Proxy is used when there is isolation between management network and workload network and the VKS clusters cannot reach NSX manager.

We recommend to use Supervisor Management Proxy over NSX Management Proxy. The two proxies cannot be used together. If you are already using NSX Management Proxy, consider migrating to Supervisor Management Proxy for additional usecases. Contact Broadcom support for migration steps.

NSX Management Proxy is deprecated since vSphere 9.0. We still maintain it for vSphere 8.0.* - 9.0.*, but will not maintain it for future vSphere releases.

### NSX Management Proxy Versions
- For vSphere 8.0 Update 3 or later
  - v0.2.2
- For vSphere 8.0 Update 3
  - v0.2.1
  - v0.1.1

NSX Management Proxy Sample `values.yaml`
- Download sample values.yaml from the same location as Service yaml. Make sure to fill the property `nsxManagers` with your NSX Manager IP(s).

**Note:** NSX Management Proxy is supported in vSphere 8.0 Update 3 when Supervisor Clusters are enabled using VMware NSX-T networking stack under following configurations:
- NSX Load Balancer is configured as load balancing solution.
- NSX Gateway Firewall is enabled.

## [Data Services Manager Consumption Operator](https://support.broadcom.com) <a id='data-services-manager-consumption-operator'></a>

#### Please refer to [How to find and install Supervisor Services](#how-to-find-and-install-supervisor-services) to find and install supervisor services.

The Data Services Manager(DSM) Consumption Operator facilitates native, self-service access to DSM within a Kubernetes environment. It exposes a selection of resources supported by the DSM provider, allowing customers to connect to the DSM provider from Kubernetes. Although the DSM provider does not currently support tenancy natively, the DSM Consumption Operator enables customers to seamlessly integrate their existing tenancy model, effectively introducing tenancy into the DSM provider.

- The DSM provider is a prerequisite for DSM consumption operator, so that must be installed first.
- Installation instructions can be found [here in VMware documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-services-workloads/GUID-A0A5F6D4-87A4-46CA-A50A-33664F43F299.html)
