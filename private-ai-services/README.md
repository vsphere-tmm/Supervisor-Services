# Private AI Services

Private AI Services is part of [VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA 9.0](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/dam/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/pdf/vmware/private-ai/private-ai-nvidia/vmware-private-ai-foundation-with-nvidia-9-0.pdf).  More information is available in [this blog post](https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2025/06/19/private-ai-services-new-in-vmware-private-ai-foundation-with-nvidia-in-vcf-9-0/).

Here we're publishing some example YAML files to help you get started with Private AI Services on VCF 9.

You must have first installed and configured the Private AI Services service into a VCF Supervisor cluster.

Then, within a tenant namespace, you can use:

- [An example `PAISConfiguration`](paisconfiguration.yaml) to configure a tenant namespace
- (coming soon) example `ModelEndpoint` resources for running language models within your namespace
