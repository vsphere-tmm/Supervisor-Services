# Known Issues and Limitations

- For 8.0U3 installations: 
    - Occasionally, the plug-in may fail to load on the initial attempt. To check if the plug-in has loaded correctly, click the **vSphere Client** menu icon, then to **Administration** -> **Client** -> **Plug-ins**. Check the Status column of the VMware Local Consumption Interface plug-in, and in case you see a *Plug-in Configuration with Reverse Proxy failed.* message, reinstall the plug-in.
    - Following features for VKS are not supported:
        - Ability to retire a TKC and upgrade a TKC from VKr 1.32.x --> 1.33.x is not available.
        - Ability to configure a Windows node pool to use Group Managed Service Accounts.
        - Ability to upgrade a CAPI Cluster with atleast one Ubuntu worker nodes from VKr 1.32.x --> 1.33.x
        - ClusterClass 3.4.0 onwards, VKr 1.33.x and higher.

- You must uninstall version 1.0.x before using the 9.0.x version of LCI. Failure to do so will result in the interface not starting correctly when looking at the `Resources` tab for a namespace.

- The UI allows users to publish VKS cluster VMs that are currently deployed. The published image will not be usable and users should not leverage this feature for such VMs.

- In VKS IaaS plugin:
    - You must enter or modify a new value on any field in the dialog when adding a volume.
    - If you want to update the Cluster to newer ClusterClass post retiring its TKC, first remove "kubernetes.vmware.com/skip-auto-cc-rebase: ''" annotation by editing (and saving) the Cluster YAML via the YAML editor shown on click of "View Yaml" button, before proceeding to upgrade the Cluster.
    - To upgrade a Cluster to a VKR containing multiple Ubuntu OS versions, add 'os-version' field to the annotations by editing (and saving) the Cluster YAML via the YAML editor shown on click of "View Yaml" button, before proceeding to upgrade the Cluster.

- Resource updates will not automatically refresh in the UI. Users need to use the reload button to refresh the views on the resources.

- [Previous release notes](./Release_Notes_9_0_0.md)

# Fixed Issues

- Storage classes in non stretch supervisor environments should be correctly populated to allow successful deployment of VM, VKS Clusters and Volumes.
