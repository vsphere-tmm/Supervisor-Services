# LCI : Local Consumption Interface 9.0.0
Known issues and limitations of the Consumption Interface Supervisor Service

# What's New in 9.0.0
## VM Service
- Guided workflows now include CloudInit, Sysprep, LinuxPrep, vAppConfig
- Support for creating VMs in zones
- Guided workflow for creating VM from an ISO image
- Ability to update VM service class to resize CPU/memory usage only
- Ability to create multiple network interfaces with different subnet selection


## VKS
- LCI 9.0.0 is compatible with VKS v3.0 through v3.4, and can be used for managing the lifecycle of clusters with any of these versions.
- However, LCI 9.0.0 does not support the features introduced in VKS 3.3 and VKS 3.4. These features will be supported in a future LCI release.
- New features
    - Add support for consuming multiple Content Libraries configured for Kubernetes Service on Supervisor for both Cluster and TanzuKubernetesCluster API
    - Add support for vSphere Zones for both Cluster and TanzuKubernetesCluster API
    - Introduced following Cluster Day 2 actions
        - Increase Replicas
        - Update VM Class
        - Add/Update/Delete Volumes
    - Support for variables introduced in builtin-generic-v3.2.0 cluster class

VKS v3.2.0 introduced the concept of versioned cluster class objects. It shipped with cluster class builtin-generic-v3.2.0 which introduces a new variable schema. LCI 9.0.0 adds supports for this schema.

Please see the documentation for these variables here: [ClusterClass Variables for Customizing a Cluster](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/using-tkg-service-with-vsphere-supervisor/provisioning-tkg-service-clusters/using-the-builtin-generic-v3-2-0-clusterclass/clusterclass-variables-for-customizing-a-cluster.html)

## Standalone LCI
Admins can provide a link to launch LCI independent of granting access to the vSphere client

# Known Issues

- For 8.0U3 installations: Occasionally, the plug-in may fail to load on the initial
attempt. To check if the plug-in has loaded correctly, click the **vSphere Client**
menu icon, then to **Administration** -> **Client** -> **Plug-ins**.
Check the Status column of the VMware Local Consumption Interface plug-in, and in case you see a *Plug-in
Configuration with Reverse Proxy failed.* message, reinstall the plug-in.

- You must uninstall version 1.0.x before using the 9.0.0 version of LCI. Failure to do so will result in the interface not starting correctly when looking at the `Resources` tab for a namespace.

- There may be issues recognizing storage classes in non stretch supervisor environments. When this happens, you will see that storage class information is not available. Install LCI 9.0.1 when it becomes available to address this issue.

- The UI allows users to publish TKG cluster VMs that are currently deployed. The published image will not be usable and users should not leverage this feature for such VMs.

- Resource updates will not automatically refresh in the UI. Users need to use the reload button to refresh the views on the resources.
